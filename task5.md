## This is the last task which is to carry out GLS = GateLevel Simulation

<p align="justify">Before we carry out GLS we must have performed synthesis and successfully must have obtained gatelevel netlist of the given design. The following will be the fewer steps to perform the synthesis to obtain the gatelevel netlist.</p>
  
<br><b>Synthesis directory synth will have the following in it</b>

#### The GLS is done on obtained netlist. The following results are obtained performing simulation on obtained gatelevel netlist.
<br><b>ADD operation</b>
